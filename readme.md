## Introduction to Scikit-Learn, Using Logistic Regression as an Example

The first wave of data scientists were arguably chosen for their programming and statistical abilities. It was soon realized that the ability to effectively communicate the results of data science would be a focus for the next hiring wave. Most recently, the need for data scientists that can train others has become apparent.

I believe that a company that hires an effective data scientist who can also become a mentor and/or trainer to incoming data science hires will have a great advantage as the data science revolution continues.

This example lesson was chosen to demonstrate the ease of use of the scikit-learn package. A logistic regression model is built and the student is asked to create a similar model using another dataset.
